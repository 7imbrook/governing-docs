Contributing
============
If you'd like to contribute back to any of the SSE's governing documents, we
recommend that you [fork the repository][1] and [create a pull request][2] with
your changes. Since the SSE does have an internal process for handling changes
to these documents, we will review your changes and they may be merged back
into our official documents.
